# MetaMail Frontend

MetaMail(https://metamail.ink) is the web3 email provider.


With MetaMail users use wallet/ENS as email address (e.g. suneal.eth@mmail.ink), and sign/encrypt to ensure the security. MetaMail is compatible with other mail like Gmail. All those features are totally free, no gas-fee.
